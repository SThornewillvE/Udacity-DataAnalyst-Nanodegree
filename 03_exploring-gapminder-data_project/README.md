# Udacity-Project---Exploring-Gapminder-Data
Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree Project 03 - Exploring Gapminder Data using Python

***

## Description


In this project I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings on it using Python. (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.) Note that it shares the same sort of structure as my first analysis.

The datasets I have chosen are from Gapminder World who have collected information about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years and on a number of different indicators.

For this project, I will be choosing at least 3 indicators to investigate. The indicators I have chosen are:

1. Service workers

2. Industry workers

3. Agriculture workers

4. GDP per captia

5. Median Age


### Steps

1. Take a look at the dataset and brainstorm of some directing questions

2. Use Python to answer the questions I am interested in

3. Create a report sharing the answers

4. Using statistics and machine learning is optional

### Submission

The project will be submitted as a report (PDF) bundled with the python code which was used either in .py or .ipynb format. I will likely work with .py and convert to .ipynb to make the code accessible.

## Important files

* /data_csv/ - contains all of the data from data_xlsx except the first sheet is converted to comma seperated values as well as other CSV files

* /data_xlsx/ - contains data from gapminder before converting to csv

* /investigate-a-dataset.ipynb - contains code from investigate-a-dataset.py except in more readable format

* /investigate-a-dataset.py contains the basic code without all of the comments before porting over to ipynb format

* /investigate-a-dataset-template.ipynb - contains a teplate for the data analysis process. Although I will not be using the template directly, I will use it to help inform my process
