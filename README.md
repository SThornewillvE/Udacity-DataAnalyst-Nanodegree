# Data Analyst Nanodegree Repository

## Important files and notes

The Data Analyst Nanodegree required 8 projects to be completed in order to be graduated. My work for each project can be found in the subdirectories of this repository with their own accompanying READMEs.

Note that although this nanodegree was completed in Feb of 2018, I am compiling all of the projects together into one repo for my own convienience. 

References and citations can be found in the READMEs as necessary.
