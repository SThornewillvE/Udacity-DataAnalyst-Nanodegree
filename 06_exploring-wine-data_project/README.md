# Udacity-Project---Exploring-Wine-Data
Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree Project 06 - Exploring Wine Data using R

## Description

For this section of the Udacity course, I will be doing a data analysis on a set similar to the gapminder analysis

I chose a dataset with higher data maturity in the interest of time. The next project will be centered around data wrangling.

### Steps:

1. Get to know the data
  * Read the meta-data
  * Understand how each feature is measured
  * Are there any innate biases I should be aware of?
  * What are some questions that I am interested in?
2. Create scatter matrix to find quick and dirty correlations as a starting point
3. Analysis:
  * Draw comparisons
  * Identify trends
  * Engage a wide audience
  * Explain a complicated finding
  * Clarify a gap between perception and reality
  * Enable the reader to digest large amount of info
4. Make sure that plots are well presented w/ titles
5. Check that code is commented and documented in a way that is easy to read, understand and comprehend
6. Conclude and reflect upon findings
  * What were the difficulties?
  * What were the successes?
  * How could the analysis be enriched or built upon?

### Submission:

The final analysis will take the form of an HTML document which contains a plot of the data, analysis of said plot and outlines the steps taken:

* What tools were used for each step
* How calculations were performed
* Key considerations when analyzing the trends

All code used will be placed in this repository for inspection.

## Important files & Installation Notes

* investigating-a-dataset.Rmd - R-markdown file with analysis to be compiles to HTML

* data/* - contains data (as CSV files) and meta data for analysis
