# Create a Tableau Story
Analysing real-world data using tableau.

## Description

The purpose of this investigation is to explore a dataset using Tableau and create a explanatory data visualisation (dashboard) from my findings.

By performing this investigation I will gain a deeper understanding of how to analyse data and, most importantly, tell a story based on what findings I think are the most important.

I decided that I would do an analysis on the League of Legends Ranked Matches dataset on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/). The questions that I will be investigating in this analysis are along the lines of, "what are the most powerful champions in the current meta"?

### Steps:

1. Choose a Dataset
2. Get to know the data
  * What features exist within the data?
  * How was the data measured?
  * Are there any possible biases in the data?
3. Clean the data
  * Are there missing values?
    * What kind of imputation, if any, would be required?
  * Are the datatypes appropriate and consistent?
  * Is the formatting within each feature consistent?
  * Are there any features or rows that should be removed?
  * I will clean this data using R
4. Perform EDA in Tableau
  * Perform  univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyses.
  * Keep notes of your findings in a markdown file, saving figures as necessary
5. Structure Explanatory Data Analysis
  * Consider the most important findings
  * Form a story from these findings
  * Find the figures that outlines this story best
  * Make a sketch on paper as to how these figures can be tied together in a dashboard
6. Production
  * Make the dashboard
  * Make a final summary in a markdown file
7. Get feedback from peers
  * Note feedback
  * Consider what questions and difficulties they are and develop further on these points
8. Adjust your work based on feedback
9. Submit work

### Submission:

This project will be submitted as a tableau public dashboard with a written summary explaining the major points.

## Important files & Installation Notes

* This project requires Tableau
* Data can be found within the data file, along with the data dictionary.
  * the uncleaned and compressed datasets will be ignored by git to save on space.
  * If you want to download the dataset, see the references section
* The wrangled data is too large to upload to GitHub and so I uploaded the data
to Evernote which you can find [here](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s234/sh/69dafd82-0886-45dd-92a6-db0f93060373/63a2921f8551d992c9e77b8c7ad651d2).
  * alternatively, you can download the data from the references section,
  download the R code and run it.
